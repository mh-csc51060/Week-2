Because I am using onlineGDB I couldn't find a way to import the libraries required to do unit testing. So I wrote a unit test program that calls the function and checks the result.

The unit test program runs the function then checks that the resulting numbers are all prime and that they result in the original number when multiplied back together.

The PrimeFactors.cs is the main program and Assignment-2-Unit-Test is the testing program. The unit testing program doesn't take input but the for loop can be adjusted to change what is inputted to the function and what is passed to the test functions.
